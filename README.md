# Book-Order-Processing-System (JAVA SPRING MVC FRAMEWORK).

# Project Statement:
You are required to analyze, design and implement a database system to support the operations of a simplified online bookstore. Also, you are required to create the necessary forms to perform these operations.

# There are two parts of the project:
## Part I:
### I.I Database Relations.
### I.II Operations.
### I.III Physical Design.

## Part 2:
### Discriminate between two types of users: managers and customers and add some functionalities to each type.
### Only previously registered users can login to the system.
### New customers are able to sign up for a new customer account by providing the necessary information: user name, password, last name, first name, e-mail address, phone number, and shipping address.
### A registered customer can do the following activities: (Edit his personal information including his/her password, Search for books by any of the bookâ€™s attributes, Add books to a shopping cart, Manage his shopping cart, Checkout a shopping cart, Logout of the system).

### Note: Jasper library is used for the reports on sale which include (The total sales for books in the previous month, The top 5 customers who purchase the most purchase amount in descending order for the last three months, The top 10 selling books for the last three months).

### All the Code Currently in (Helper) folder (Functionality and Controller), Need to be separated and distributed on other Controllers and Repositories.

### Project Consists of 3 Modules (Registeration&login - Cart - All other management for books) Modules are separated and are not connected together so you can connect them easily after modifying and doing your requirements.

### All the configuration required are in pom.xml & servlet-context.xml and you need to have mysql-connector-java-8.0.16 in your project  directory so you can connect with the DB without any problem.

### Sql file is uploaded too so you can modify if you want :)
